Click on image for the identities of\\nthe other players and the original source.\\nBenedikt Schack\\nBenedikt Emanuel Schack[1] (Czech: Benedikt\\nŽák) (7 February 1758 – 10 December 1826) was a\\ncomposer and tenor of the Classical era, a close\\nfriend of Mozart and the first performer of the role\\nof Tamino in Mozart\\'s opera The Magic Flute.\\nBenedikt Schack (also spelled as Žák, Ziak, Cziak or\\nSchak) was born on 7 February 1758 in Mirotice,\\nBohemia (now the Czech Republic, then part of the\\nHabsburg monarchy). Like Joseph and Michael\\nHaydn, he worked as a chorister as a child, singing\\nfrom 1773 in the cathedral in Prague,[2] then moved\\nto Vienna (1775) to study medicine, philosophy and\\nsinging. His voice teacher in Vienna was Karl\\nFrieberth, a tenor who performed under Joseph\\nHaydn.[3] From 1780, Schack worked for several\\nyears as Kapellmeister to Prince Heinrich von\\nSchönaich-Carolath in Silesia.\\nIn 1786, Schack joined the traveling theatrical\\ntroupe of Emanuel Schikaneder, working both as a\\ntenor and as a composer of Singspiele. The troupe\\nsettled in Vienna in 1789, performing in the\\nsuburban Theater auf der Wieden.\\nIt was around this time that Schack became a friend and professional colleague of Mozart, who was\\ngradually increasing his involvement with Schikaneder\\'s troupe. Schack apparently asked his\\nfriend for advice and help in composing,[4] and the level of assistance evidently increased. The\\nfollowing anecdote was published in the Baierisches Musik-Lexikon by Felix Joseph von Lipowsky\\n(Munich, 1811):\\nMozart often came to Schack to fetch him for a stroll; while Schack dressed he would sit\\nat the writing desk and compose here and there a piece in Schack\\'s operas. Thus several\\npassages in Schack\\'s operas derive from Mozart\\'s own hand and genius.[5]\\nIn 1790, Schack and his fellow singer-composers of the Schikaneder troupe collaborated to write\\nan opera Der Stein der Weisen (\"The Philosopher\\'s Stone\"). Mozart also played a part in its\\ncomposition, contributing a duet (\"Nun liebes Weibchen,\" K. 625/592a)[6] and perhaps other\\nEarly life\\nFriendship and\\ncollaborations with Mozart\\n6/27/24, 6:32 PM\\nBenedikt Schack - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedikt_Schack\\n1/4'}"
